# Implementation Hints:

Create an **Employee** class which will be a base class for **SalesEmployee** & **AccountantEmployee**.

- you should create at least 2 Accountants (Oscar and Kevin are way nicer than Angelina)
- this will allow you *to choose which accountant* you'd like to generate a report for
- **SalesEmployee** class includes a collection of **Sale**

When creating a **Sale**, you should enter all the information pertaining to that sale, and your Name should automatically be populated ( you already entered it in Step 1 ü§Ø )

- note here a class should be made
- create a client # to identify by

Generating a report:

- Iterate over a collection of Sales to give to the chosen Accountant that shows the following:
    1. each **SalesEmployee** and all of their clients
    2. at the end of that employee's clients, show the total sales amount for that month
        1. This can be displayed however you like

One of the menu options states to "Find a Sale", enter a client's # and display that **Sale** with the corresponding seller. 

### ****Keep in mind the application should keep running until you press '5' to exit it....

## Stretch Goals ‚≠ê

Add the concept of Offices.  

- Each sales person should be in an office.
- I should have to select or create a new office on the first screen
- I should be able to create a report based on the sales of an entire office rather than individual sales people.
- The salesperson report should only contain the currently selected office
